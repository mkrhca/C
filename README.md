Who the hell are you to come to my home for charging your laptop? 

This is not the first time am warning you to stop stalking me. 

Just because i answered your queries related to water problem in my neighbourhood around 9 months, you have been stalking me. Are you not ashamed to behave like this with a girl of your daughter's age? 

Am listing some of the incidents that has happened in the last 9 months or so.
1. You asked me in office bus about which side of the main road is my house located saying you are looking at shift house due to water problems. I answered believing you were genuinely looking for a new house. 
2. The very next day you gave a sweet box saying it was given for diwali. Though i tried to reject it I later took it because i felt it would be embarassing for me to reject it more strongly in office bus. 
3. You deliberately walked with me saying some house broker is waiting and started conversations with me. Any girl would feel a bit hesitant to be harsh with a man of her father's age when confronting such situations. I too felt the same way. 
4. The next working day you show up in my floor in the pretext of some official work. Though you planned meticulously for that meeting to look like a coincidence, my mind got the warning signal that you are not what you look or present yourself as. 
5. From that day I have always tried to keep myself away from you. You deliberately kept playing songs loud enough to irritate me as well as other staffs travelling in office bus. 
6. You always sat in seats adjacent or near my seat. Due to this i couldnt even sit relaxed in any seat i prefer. I deliberaltely sat in the front seats to avoid your naggings. 
7. You volunteered to inform me that you shifted your house to 3 streets away from where i stay. This was done without me asking about your place of stay. I have clearly told not to do this small talks with me and am not interested. I made this in a harsh tone but iI realized very late that harsh words have no effect on a psycho like you.
8. You started stalking me in the evenings after i get down from bus. It will evident from the CCTV footages of the main road. 
9. In the morning when I walk from home to the bus boarding point, you came in auto, stopped the auto and asked if I want to come in auto. I told you to mind your business. From then, my independence of walking too has been snatched away.
10. Then you started conversation as if you were giving temple prasadam. On that instance i clearly told not to talk with me.
11. Your stalkings continued in the evenings irrespective of telling you many times directly and indirectly. It is evident you dont have common sense or know how to respect females. 
12. You befriended my neighbour and tried that friendship as an excuse to visit my flat. When i told my neighbour about your behaviour and he didnt allow tou to come to flat, you started telling everyone you see that you want to shift you home to the exact street I live in. 
13. You pinged me in Skype unneccessarily asking something irrelevant. I asked my cousin to come home to call you and warn you. When he called you spoke as if you did nothing and told you wont trouble me. 
14. When my neighbour vacated the house, you used house brokers to shift your home to my flat. I asked the house owner specifically who is the new tenant and not to give to any bachelors & I explained the problems faced by you. The house owner told it was some family and the person is working in ICICI bank. The next day he called me because he got suspicious due to the restless behaviour from your side to occupy the house. Later the house owner denied offering the house for rent to you. This incident has proved that you neither have common sense nor humanity. 
15. I blocked you in skype and then you forwarded an email. Who are you to forward any emails at all? 
16. Now you are sending email asking if you can come to my home to charge your laptop. 

You could have lot of money, made lot of friends with your fake smile hiding behind your real vicious identity. 
You may have worked many years in SCB singapore and may have many contacts within the bank. 
You may have many other things that you think are advantageous for you and indulge in filthy, indecent behaviours. 

Whatever you are and whatever you have, if you ever again try to contact me by any means, I will go to any extent to make you not repeat the same mistake not just to me but to any other females in your entire lifetime. 

This is my finaly warning in the most polite way possible. Do NOT ever try to communicate with me. MIND YOUR BUSINESS.
